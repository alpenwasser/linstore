	<span style="font-size:24px;"><strong>Welcome to the LinusTechTips 10TB+ Storage Showoff Topic,</strong></span><br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	(aka the <span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>LTT Petabyte Club</strong></span>, as of April 15th, 2014)<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Topic:</strong><br>
	A topic like this seems to be mandatory on tech forums, so here it is!<br>
	In essence this topic is for your large storage systems that you wish to show off.<br>
	But it&#39;s not limited to large server only, you can also post your smaller build.<br>
	As a result this will be a very nice place for people to brainstorm about their own future storage builds!<br>
	<br>
	The list of the systems, along with some statistics about the systems and HDDs used, will be maintained in the post below this one.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Criteria:</strong><br>
	Here are the criteria to get in 10TB+ list:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		It has to be a dedicated server system (so no work/game stations), NAS and virtualization are oke though.
	</li>
	<li>
		A total capacity of at least 10TB.
	</li>
	<li>
		It has to be one system. (all running off one motherboard)
	</li>
	<li>
		It has to be private/ home storage, don&#39;t post your company&#39;s data-server! (unless its Linus Media Group)
	</li>
	<li>
		Pics or it didn&#39;t happen, and write a nice post about your system.
	</li>
	<li>
		Use my post as a template for your post (Don&#39;t forget to indicate vendor and size for your disks so we can use that for our statistics).
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<strong>Capacity Calculation:</strong><br>
	I decided to make it easy for you by not paying attention to RAID.<br>
	So if you have 10 1TB drives then it&#39;s 10TB worth of storage.<br>
	Always use advertised space, so 1TB=1TB (not 931GB).<br>
	<br>
	Small boot drives and cache drives are excluded from the count, this way we will end up with a nice round number for most systems.<br>

	<strong>SMALLER SERVERS/Noteworthy builds that didn&#39;t make the list:</strong><br>
	As I said before, I want this to be a inspirational topic for people who want to build their own server.<br>
	But not everyone needs 10TB+, so for noteworthy builds (either due to awesomeness, or just an elegant solution for somebody who wants to build a NAS but doesn&#39;t need a huge server), there is a second (unranked/unordered) list. Feel free to submit your storage build even if it doesn&#39;t quite match the size criteria and it might just make that list (and it could always get into the actual rankings when you upgrade to more storage).
</p>

<p>
	Builds with less than 10 TB capacity don&#39;t count towards the statistics.

	<strong>External Sites:</strong><br>
	This topic is inspired by the topic at <a href="http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1393939" rel="external nofollow">Hard Forum</a>, if you want to see huge storage systems then go there.<br>
	Another forum I want to point out is the dutch <a href="http://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/1457031/0" rel="external nofollow">Gathing of Tweakers</a>, but its in dutch so not for everyone (nice pics though)<br>
	Last but not least, <a href="http://forums.servethehome.com/diy-storage-server-builds/" rel="external nofollow">Serverthehome.com</a>, also a great forum if you want to see nice storage builds.<br>

	<span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Ranking Script</strong></span>, <span style="font-size:10px;">(added by alpenwasser, 2014-APR-18)</span>
</p>

<p>
	The ranking list is generated by a Perl script, which is hosted in a github repo <a href="https://github.com/alpenwasser/ltt-storage-rankings" rel="external nofollow">here</a>, for those interested.<br>
	<br>
	Systems are ranked first by capacity, then by posting date. Builds smaller than 10 TB are split out into a second list, which is not sorted in any particular fashion. If a build with less than 10 TB storage capacity is updated to 10 TB or more, it will automatically be moved into the actual rankings. The statistics are compiled from the main list only.<br>
	<br>
	The total storage capacity is based on the actual rankings, builds with less than 10 TB capacity do not count towards it.
