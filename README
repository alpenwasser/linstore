Linus Tech Tips Storage Ranking Script



generate-ltt-rankings.pl will  generate the BB code  for the
storage rankings list, including whitespace for formatting.



USAGE:

- Make sure  all entries  in the  %MASTER_RECORD are  up  to
  date.
- Run generate-ltt-rankings.pl, pipe output into file.
- Copy  file content  into the forum  post with  the ranking
  list. It is important that the post be edited in rich text
  mode  (not  raw  BBCode mode)  in  order  to preserve  the
  whitespace for the table layout. Editing in raw mode, then
  saving post, will remove all whitespace padding.
- Select entire post, set font to Courier.
- Save post.
