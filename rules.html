<div>
    Welcome to the <strong>LTT  Storage Rankings</strong>! The purpose of this
    topic is to  show off cool storage  builds, to inspire with  what you show
    and be  inspired by  what you  see. And of course,  also talk  about those
    builds, ask their owners questions and all that good stuff.

<h2 style="font-size:1.1em;background-color:#486784;color:#ffffff;padding:0.33em;padding-left:1em;margin-bottom:2em;margin-top:3em;"><strong>Criteria</strong></h2>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            System capacity of 10 TB or more
        </li>
        <li>
            5 storage drives or more:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We don't count OS drives,
                </li>
                <li>
                    we also do not count cache drives,
                </li>
                <li>
                    nor external USB drives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    External SAS enclosures connected via SFF-8088 count, however.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drobos, Thunderbolt enclosures etc.: If they have a management interface which makes them somewhat autonomous, they count.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It does not matter whether your storage drives is an SSD or an HDD, as long as it is used for storage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Don't forget to indicate vendor and drive size for all your drives for our statistics (see also below).
                </li>
                <li>
                    For cases not covered here, we reserve the right to adjust the rules as needed to protect the spirit of the thread.

        </li>
        <li>
            It has to be a single system (everything running off of a single motherboard).
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not post your company server (except the ones from Linus Media Group ;)), this is for private systems.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pictures of the hardware required. That's the primary point of this thread, after all.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use <a href="https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/21948-ltt-10tb-storage-show-off-topic/?do=findComment&comment=273427">looney's post</a> as a template. 
            Write a nice post about your system, give us some details on the nitty gritty inner workings of your beast.
        </li>
        <li>
             Make sure to give all the needed info for the statistics (Operating system, storage system, HDD vendors and sizes etc.)

<h2 style="font-size:1.1em;background-color:#486784;color:#ffffff;padding:0.33em;padding-left:1em;margin-bottom:2em;margin-top:3em;"><strong>Ranking System</strong></h2>
<div>
    <p>
    The rankings are based on ranking points, which are calculated as follows:
    <div style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, Monospace;color:#db4105;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:0.9em;">ranking_points = system_capacity &#x2a2f; ln(system_drive_count)</div>
    with <span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, Monospace;color:#db4105;">ln(system_drive_count)</span> being the natural logarithm of the number of drives in the system.
    </p>

    <h3>Rationales</h3>
    <h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>
    <p>
    Having both the 10  TB and the 5 drive minimum rules  allows us to prevent
    being spammed by systems with a single  or two huge HDDs (10 terabyte HDDs
    are a reality now, after all), while still allowing systems which were put
    together with smaller drives (or SSDs) to get into the list.
    </p>

    <h4>Ranking Points</h4>
    <p>
    Basically, this thread is about awesome storage systems, and we think that
    capacity isn't the only thing which  determines how cool a storage machine
    is. Chances are  that a system  with a bit less  capacity but quite  a few
    more drives might be more interesting to look at. Therefore, the number of
    drives also counts.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, we  don't want  somebody buying  a ton of  small cheap  drives to
    outrank somebody  who's bought  a hugely expensive  system with  fewer big
    drives, which  is why towards  the upper end of  the scale, the  number of
    drives starts to no longer matter as much (see examples below).
    </p>

    <h5>Example for Large Systems</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>System 1:</strong> 100 TB capacity, 50 &#x2a2f; 2 TB drives: 391.2 ranking points
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>System 2:</strong> 150 TB capacity, 30 &#x2a2f; 5 TB drives: 510.2 ranking points
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Amount of drives required for system 1 to surpass system 2, assuming capacities for both systems and drive count for system 2 stay the same:</strong> 
            165  drives, resulting  in 510.6  ranking points. Capacity  weighs
            much heavier  than drive count as  it grows, the influence  of the
            number of  drives on the ranking  points falls prey to  the law of
            diminishing returns.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Example for Smaller Systems</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>System 3:</strong> 14 TB capacity, 7 &#x2a2f; 2 TB drives: 27.2 ranking points
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>System 4:</strong> 15 TB capacity, 5 &#x2a2f; 3 TB drives: 24.1 ranking points
        </li>
        <li>
            Drive count has  a higher weight for such systems,  system 3 ranks
            ahead of system 4 despite having less total capacity.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Identical Ranking Points</h5>
    <p>
    For systems with identical ranking points, post date is the ranking factor
    (more  specifically: post  number).   Since  no posts  can  have the  same
    number, no more ranking criteria are needed.
    </p>

    <h5>Script</h5>
    <p>
    The rankings and plots are generated by a Python script, which can be found on
    <a href="https://github.com/alpenwasser/linstore">alpenwasser's github here</a>.

    <h4>Capacity Calculation</h4>
    <p>
    We count raw storage as advertised on  the drives. So, if you have 10 1 TB
    drives, that counts towards 10 TB of storage.
    </p>

<div>
    <p>
    Not everybody needs a big server, and even smaller systems can be cool and
    interesting (or <em>noteworthy</em>, as we put it below). For such systems
    we have  a secondary list, so  feel free to  post your machine even  if it
    doesn't quite meet  the ranking criteria outlined  above. Please still use
    the template post for  your system, and stick to the  rest of the criteria
    as applicable to your machine.
